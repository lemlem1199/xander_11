                                        <P>1. Checkmate the King: The ultimate goal is to trap your opponent's king so it can't move without being captured. <br>
                                        2. Protect Your King: Keep your own king safe by moving pieces to safe place. <br>
                                        3. Capture Opponent’s Pieces: Take your opponent’s pieces off the board to weaken their position<br>
                                        4. Control the Board: Use your pieces to control important squares and limit your opponent’s movements.<br>
                                        5. Develop Your Pieces: Move your knights, bishops, rooks, and queen to active positions early in the game to set up for attacks.</p>
